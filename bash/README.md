# Bash Track

>   Bash is a Unix command interpreter
>   Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command interpreter,
>   it is really a programming language in which each statement runs a command. 
>   Because it must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command
>   execution, it is a strange language, shaped as much by history as by design.
>   —- Brian Kernighan & Rob Pike

Here are my files for completing the `bash-language` track.
